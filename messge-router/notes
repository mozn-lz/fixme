The router is the central component of your applications. 
All other components connect to it in order to send messages to other components. 
The router will perform no buiness logic, it will just dispatch messages to the destination component(s). 
The router must accept incomming connections from multiple brokers and markets. 
We call the router a market connetivity provider, because it allows brokers to send messages (in FIX format)
to markets, without depending on specific implementation of the market.

The router will listen on 2 ports:
• Port 5000 Broker messages components.
 Router asigns it a unique 6 digit ID and communicates the ID to the Broker.

• Port 5001 for messages from Market components. 
Router asigns it a unique 6 digit ID and communicates the ID to the Market.

Brokers and Markets will include the assigned ID in all messages for identification
and the Router will use the ID to create the routing table.
Once the Router receives a message it will perform 3 steps:
• Validate the message based on the checkshum.
• Identify the destination in the routing table.
• Forward the message.
